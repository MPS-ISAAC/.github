# Project MPS-ISAAC: Hands-on Activities for OT-CPS Devices

A list of our hands-on activities are as follows:
1. Introduce Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs)
    * Connect to an IED
    * Communicate with an IED
2. Introduce Remote Terminal Units (RTUs)
    * Connect to and communicate with an RTU
    * Establish connectivity and data transactions between RTU and IEDs
3. Introduce Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs)
    * Get acquainted with HMI functions and characteristics
    * Create a custom HMI using Schweitzer Engineering Labs (SEL) diagram builder
4. Commissioning a new device into an existing system of networks
    * Commission SEL 351
    * Complete installation guide by following reference manuals
5. OT Network establishment, configuration, and maintenance
    * Configure and deploy SEL 3622: a network security gateway
    * Password management, proxy access points, and direct access points
6. OT-Network data communications
    * Connecting managed ethernet switches to IEDs
    * Conduct network stress, congestion tests using Ostinato
    * Observe network performance using Wireshark
7. Quality of service determination for OT-Networks
    * Create a loop network connection and run two experiments: one with Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) and another with no RSTP 
    * For each experiment measure: packet loss, throughput, latency, jitter, and spanning tree convergence time
8. Establish a connection from an automation controller to a downstream relay
    * Device options: SEL 849, 421, 451, 311, 487, 3530 and KoCoS ARTES 460
    * Protocol options: DNP3, Modbus, Goose, Ethernet
